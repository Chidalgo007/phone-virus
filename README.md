As part of a university project, I developed a simulation focusing on virus transmission between cellphones based on proximity. </br>
Each cellphone operated independently as a thread within the simulation. The objective was to simulate the spread of a virus among cellphones, </br>
with infected devices having a limited time to recover before potentially "dying" or disappearing. Once three or more cellphones were infected, </br>
one was randomly chosen to visit a repair shop, sequentially, showcasing the dynamics of viral spread and system maintenance.</br>
</br>
To interact with the simulation, users could launch the .jar file and dynamically add cellphones using the UP arrow key. </br>
Pressing the letter "v" initiated the infection process, randomly selecting a cellphone to become contagious. This project not only </br>
demonstrated my proficiency in concurrent programming and simulation design but also underscored my ability to model real-world scenarios </br>
using computational techniques.</br>
